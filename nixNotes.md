# Kiss

Keep it simple for diagramming....

As is:

we can do boxes with text, tooltip and a payload for copy/paste.

We can do flows left to right, in three different line styles
(represent flow, sync and async?)

Boxes and lines can have colors

All have color, text, description, payload.

Expansion:

Overall:

- Allow Light/Dark theme for printing
- Allow SVG export

Boxes:

- Allow different shapes (circle, rounded rectangle, diamond)
- Allow different border styles (dashed, dotted, double)
- Allow Storage boxes
- Allow Grouping boxes

Modes:

- Allow mode circles
- Allow + and - mode influences

Lines:

- Allow line arrows (start, end, both)
- Allow line styles (dashed, dotted, double)
- Position left-right edge lines sequenced by color
  - When there is more than one line, they should be ordered by color index
- Allow lines from nodes to top of box or text box of line
- Allow lines from bottom to storage boxes
